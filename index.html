            <!-- How it started -->
            <p>Becoming a pilot isn't something I've always wanted to do. It's not something I even thought about.</p>
            <p>I had a dream one night about becoming a pilot. I remember it like it was yesterday. The dream was very vivid. Most dreams I don't really remember, but this one I did. It was weird because I never had a dream about any other careers in the past. So I took this dream as a sign and started training.</p>
            <p>After I woke up, I layed there thinking about the dream. Remembering how it felt being the PIC (Pilot in command. I didn't know that's what it meant at the time). A few minutes went by as I layed there smiling ear to ear. My mind was made up and I wanted to become a pilot and fly airplanes.</p>
